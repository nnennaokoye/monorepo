# Shelterflex Frontend

Next.js web app for Shelterflex.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- This frontend is currently UI-first and uses mock data under `lib/mockData/`.
- Backend integration should be centralized under `lib/` (avoid scattering raw `fetch` calls in components).
