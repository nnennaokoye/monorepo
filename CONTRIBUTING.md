# Contributing to Shelterflex

Thanks for contributing. This repo is intentionally split into **3 projects** (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `contracts/`) so you can contribute to one area without needing to touch the others.

If you’re looking for tasks to pick up, start with `docs/ISSUES_CATALOG.md`.

## Ways to contribute

- Frontend: UI, UX, routing, components, state management, integration with backend and Soroban
- Backend: API design, validation, auth, persistence, Soroban RPC integration, monitoring
- Contracts: Soroban smart contracts, tests, deployment scripts, security hardening

## Ground rules

- Keep PRs small and focused (1 issue per PR).
- Write clear commit messages.
- Add/adjust tests where it makes sense.
- Don’t commit secrets (`.env` files, private keys, seed phrases).

## Repo layout

- `frontend/` - Next.js app
- `backend/` - Express API
- `contracts/` - Soroban contracts (Rust)

## Development setup

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

### Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
cargo test
stellar contract build
```

For Soroban CLI deployment instructions see `contracts/README.md`.

## Creating an issue

Before opening a new issue:

- Search existing issues (open + closed).
- Confirm whether it’s FE, BE, or contract scope.
- Provide acceptance criteria and a clear definition of done.

### Issue labels (recommended)

- `area:frontend`
- `area:backend`
- `area:contracts`
- `type:bug`
- `type:feature`
- `type:chore`
- `type:security`
- `good first issue`
- `help wanted`

## Picking up an issue

- Comment on the issue saying you’re working on it.
- Ask clarifying questions early.
- If you’re blocked for >24h, leave an update.

## Before opening a PR (required checks)

Run the checks for the area you changed.

### Frontend checks

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

If your PR changes UI, include **screenshots** (or a short screen recording) in the PR description.

### Backend checks

```bash
cd backend
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

### Contracts checks

```bash
cd contracts
cargo test
stellar contract build
```

## If the repository is renamed on GitHub

If the organization renames this repository, GitHub will usually redirect the old URL to the new one.

If your local pushes start failing, update your `origin` remote URL:

```bash
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Shelterflex/monorepo.git
git remote -v
```

## Definitions of Done (per issue type)

### Frontend issues

**Bug**

- Repro steps documented in the issue.
- Fix verified locally.
- No UI regressions in the affected flows.
- If the bug is user-facing, screenshots/video before & after.

**Feature**

- UI matches the acceptance criteria.
- Routing and error states are handled.
- Any new components are reusable and placed appropriately.
- If the feature talks to the backend/contract, the integration is behind a well-defined `lib/` module.

**Chore/Refactor**

- No behavior change unless explicitly intended.
- Affected screens still render correctly.

### Backend issues

**Bug**

- Failing scenario is described.
- Fix includes validation and clear error responses.
- No breaking changes to existing endpoints unless versioned.

**Feature**

- Endpoint contract is specified (request/response schema).
- Input validation is done (zod).
- Error handling is consistent.
- CORS and env vars documented.

**Soroban integration**

- RPC URL/passphrase configurable via env.
- Clear separation between HTTP layer and Soroban client code (`src/soroban/*`).
- Logging for tx submission + failure diagnostics.

### Contract issues (Soroban)

**Bug**

- Regression test added.
- Fix is covered by unit/integration tests.

**Feature**

- Contract interface documented (methods + expected behavior).
- Events emitted for state transitions.
- Tests cover happy path and at least one failure path.

**Security hardening**

- Threat model described in the issue.
- Access control is explicit (`require_auth`).
- No panics on user-controlled inputs unless the behavior is intentional and documented.

## PR process

### 0) Fork the repo (recommended for public contributions)

- Click **Fork** on GitHub to create your own copy of the repo.
- Clone your fork locally.

### 1) Create your branch

- Create a new branch from `main`.
- Branch naming:
  - `feat/<short>`
  - `fix/<short>`
  - `chore/<short>`

### 2) Make changes (scoped)

- Keep PRs focused (ideally one issue per PR).
- If you only change one area, keep changes inside that folder:
  - `frontend/` changes should not require touching `backend/` or `contracts/`.
  - `contracts/` changes should include tests.

### 3) Commit

- Write clear commit messages.
- Don’t commit secrets (`.env`, private keys, seed phrases).

### 4) Push and open a PR

- Push your branch to your fork.
- Open a Pull Request from your fork into the organization repo’s `main` branch.
- Fill out `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Link the issue in the PR description:
  - Example: `Closes #123`

### 5) Respond to review

- Address comments by pushing new commits to the same branch.
- If requested, rebase on the latest `main`.
- Keep discussion in the PR for transparency.

## Code review checklist (what we’ll look for)

- Correctness and edge cases
- Security (especially auth and contract access control)
- Tests and/or reproducible verification steps
- Clear naming and minimal complexity
- No secrets committed
